# IRWA Assignment Gap Analysis

## Overview
This document identifies critical gaps between the current dynamic pricing AI system and the IRWA assignment marking guidelines (IT3041). These gaps must be addressed to meet academic requirements.

## Critical Gaps Identified

### 1. **Responsible AI Practices** (6 marks at risk) - CRITICAL
**Status**: Complete absence of Responsible AI implementation

**Missing Elements**:
- ❌ No fairness measures or bias detection
- ❌ No explainability features for AI decisions
- ❌ No transparency mechanisms for users
- ❌ No privacy protection implementation
- ❌ No ethical data handling practices
- ❌ No user consent mechanisms
- ❌ No audit trails for AI decisions

**Required Actions**:
- Implement fairness checks in pricing algorithms
- Add explainable AI features for price recommendations
- Create transparency reports for users
- Add privacy protection for user data
- Document ethical considerations
- Implement bias detection and mitigation

### 2. **Commercialization Plan** (6-9 marks at risk) - CRITICAL
**Status**: No business strategy or pricing model documented

**Missing Elements**:
- ❌ No target market identification
- ❌ No pricing model for the AI system
- ❌ No business strategy documentation
- ❌ No revenue model definition
- ❌ No competitive analysis
- ❌ No go-to-market strategy

**Required Actions**:
- Define target customers and market segments
- Create pricing tiers and subscription models
- Develop business case and revenue projections
- Analyze competitors and positioning
- Create implementation roadmap

### 3. **Evaluation & Results** (5 marks at risk) - HIGH PRIORITY
**Status**: No systematic evaluation methodology

**Missing Elements**:
- ❌ No performance metrics framework
- ❌ No accuracy/precision measurements
- ❌ No system effectiveness evaluation
- ❌ No comparative analysis with baselines
- ❌ No meaningful insights from results
- ❌ No evaluation reports

**Required Actions**:
- Implement evaluation metrics (accuracy, latency, user satisfaction)
- Create performance benchmarks
- Generate evaluation reports with insights
- Add A/B testing capabilities
- Document system performance over time

### 4. **NLP Integration** (System Requirements) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Status**: Limited explicit NLP techniques documentation

**Missing Elements**:
- ❌ No clear NER (Named Entity Recognition) implementation
- ❌ No text summarization features
- ❌ No sentiment analysis for market data
- ❌ No document classification for market insights

**Required Actions**:
- Document existing NLP usage in LLM interactions
- Implement explicit NLP techniques (NER, summarization)
- Add text processing for market sentiment analysis
- Create NLP pipeline documentation

### 5. **Information Retrieval Module** (System Requirements) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Status**: IR methodology not clearly defined

**Missing Elements**:
- ❌ No clear search/retrieval algorithms
- ❌ No ranking mechanisms for market data
- ❌ No query processing pipeline
- ❌ No relevance scoring for data sources

**Required Actions**:
- Document market data retrieval as IR system
- Implement search and ranking algorithms
- Add query processing capabilities
- Create relevance scoring mechanisms

## Implementation Priority

### Immediate (Week 1-2)
1. **Responsible AI Documentation** - Create comprehensive ethical framework
2. **Commercialization Plan** - Develop business strategy document
3. **Basic Evaluation Metrics** - Implement performance measurement

### Short Term (Week 3-4)
4. **NLP Documentation** - Document and enhance NLP features
5. **IR Methodology** - Clarify information retrieval approach
6. **Evaluation Framework** - Complete comprehensive testing

### Ongoing
- Continuous monitoring and improvement
- Regular evaluation and reporting
- Documentation updates

## Risk Assessment

| Gap | Current Risk | Impact on Grade | Mitigation Urgency |
|-----|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Responsible AI | Very High | 6-9 marks | Critical |
| Commercialization | Very High | 6-9 marks | Critical |
| Evaluation | High | 5 marks | High |
| NLP Integration | Medium | 2-3 marks | Medium |
| IR Methodology | Medium | 2-3 marks | Medium |
