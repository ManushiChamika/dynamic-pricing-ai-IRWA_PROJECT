✅ Show you understand WHY each design choice was made
✅ Mention fairness checks are ARCHITECTURAL, not optional
✅ Reference events.jsonl as immutable audit trail
✅ Connect design choices to responsible AI principles
✅ Mention all 3 fairness checks (variance, margin, undercut)

### DON'T
❌ Give 1-word answers
❌ Confuse REST with MCP
❌ Say fairness is "checked" (it's "enforced")
❌ Forget about the immutable audit log
❌ Claim MCP is just another protocol (it's industry standard)
❌ Ignore the business value ($2-5B market)
❌ Act uncertain about your own system

## 🎬 WHAT HAPPENS IN THE VIVA

### Structure (~20 minutes)
1. **Intro** (1 min) - "Tell us about your system in 60 seconds"
2. **Main questions** (12 mins) - Ask 3-4 of the 6 prepared questions
3. **Follow-ups** (4 mins) - Deeper questions based on your answers
4. **Demo** (2 mins) - Show system working
5. **Wrap-up** (1 min) - Final thoughts

### How to Handle Each Part

**Intro (60 seconds):**
"Our system uses 4 agents (Data Collector, Price Optimizer, Alert Service, User Interaction) that communicate via MCP for performance and immutable audit logging via Event Bus. The Alert Service enforces 3 fairness checks: variance threshold, profit margin minimum, and undercut prevention. This gives us fast pricing (~1.5s) that's fair, auditable, and compliant. The system is commercialized as 4 tiers from $99-custom."

**Main Questions:**
- Use answers from VIVA_QUICK_REFERENCE.md (adapt slightly)
- Speak naturally, not from memory
- Make eye contact
- Pause if you need to think (better than rambling)

**Follow-ups:**
- Listen carefully to the question
- Ask for clarification if needed ("Are you asking about...?")
- Connect to your system's design
- Give specific examples

**Demo:**
- Run commands from DEMO_SCRIPT.md
- Explain what happens at each step
- Show the output and what it means
