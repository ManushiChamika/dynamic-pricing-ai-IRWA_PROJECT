## 🔑 5 Things to Memorize (30 mins)

If you only have 30 minutes, memorize these 5 things:

### 1. System at a Glance
```
4 Agents: DC → PO → AS → UIA
2 Protocols: MCP (sync) + Event Bus (async)
Audit Trail: events.jsonl (182K+ events)
Time: ~1.5 seconds per request
```

### 2. Why MCP?
"10-50ms latency (vs REST 100-200ms) + industry standard + better auditability"

### 3. Fairness Checks (Alert Service)
```
Variance: < 5% of market average
Margin: > 10% above cost
Undercut: < 2 times per day
→ ARCHITECTURAL ENFORCEMENT (not optional)
```

### 4. Complete Timeline
```
T+0ms:   User query
T+10ms:  DC fetch (~23ms)
T+35ms:  PO optimize (~100ms)
T+142ms: AS validate (~5ms)
T+155ms: Result to user
```

### 5. Commercialization
```
4 Tiers: $99 (Starter) → $499 (Pro) → Custom (Enterprise) → Usage-based
Market: $2-5B wasted annually on suboptimal pricing
Differentiation: Only "fair + auditable + intelligent" pricing tool
```
