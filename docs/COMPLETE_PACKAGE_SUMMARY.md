## 🔑 5 Critical Talking Points (Memorize)

### 1️⃣ How Do Agents Communicate?

**The Answer (30 seconds):**
> "We use two communication layers. First, MCP for synchronous tool calls - when the User Interaction Agent needs to fetch data or optimize prices, it calls those agents via MCP JSON-RPC. Second, an Event Bus for asynchronous pub-sub - when something important happens (price recommendation generated, fairness check passed), we publish events that other agents subscribe to. Everything is logged to events.jsonl for auditability."

**Why it's good:**
- ✅ Shows you understand 2 layers
- ✅ Uses technical terms correctly (MCP, pub-sub, JSON-RPC)
- ✅ Mentions auditability (favorite word)
- ✅ Under 30 seconds

---

### 2️⃣ Why MCP Instead of REST?

**The Answer (30 seconds):**
> "REST would add 100-200ms latency per call and requires N² connections between agents. MCP is Anthropic's industry standard for LLM agents, gives us 10-50ms latency, and handles request correlation via UUID matching. Most importantly, MCP's structured tool-calling semantics make auditability easier - we know exactly what tool was called with what args, and we can log the entire conversation for compliance."

**Why it's good:**
- ✅ Quantifies the tradeoff (100-200ms vs 10-50ms)
- ✅ Mentions industry standard (credibility)
- ✅ Explains why it matters (auditability)
- ✅ Shows you've thought about alternatives

---

### 3️⃣ What Happens if the Price Optimizer Recommends an Unfair Price?

**The Answer (45 seconds):**
> "The Alert Service won't allow it. It's an architectural enforcement layer, not optional. Every recommendation hits three checks: variance (must stay within 5% of market average), margin protection (must be at least 10% above cost), and undercut detection (can't undercut more than twice in a day). If any check fails, we log an 'alert.rejected' event and the price never reaches the user. The system is designed so that unfair prices are impossible, not just discouraged."

**Why it's good:**
- ✅ Emphasizes architectural enforcement (not post-hoc)
- ✅ Lists specific numbers (5%, 10%, 2x)
- ✅ Shows you understand Responsible AI
- ✅ Shows you understand system design

---

### 4️⃣ Walk Me Through a Complete Pricing Request (Start to Finish)

**The Timeline (60 seconds):**

```
T+0ms    → User asks: "What's optimal price for TEST-SKU?"
T+10ms   → UIA parses NLP, calls DC: "fetch_market_data(TEST-SKU)"
T+33ms   → DC returns market avg $110.50 from 3 sources
T+35ms   → UIA calls PO: "optimize_price({market_data, history})"
T+135ms  → PO runs ML algorithm → recommends $112.70 (0.89 confidence)
T+142ms  → Event: "recommendation_generated" published to bus
T+145ms  → Alert Service subscribes → validates fairness checks
           • Variance: 1.9% < 5% ✓
           • Margin: 11.3% > 10% ✓
           • Undercut: 0 < 2 ✓
T+148ms  → Event: "alert.approved" published
T+152ms  → UIA formats response: "Recommended $112.70 (approved)"
T+155ms  → User sees result

TOTAL LATENCY: 155ms (well under 2-second SLA)
EVENTS LOGGED: 7 events in events.jsonl
```

**Why it's good:**
- ✅ Shows you know the system inside-out
- ✅ Includes specific timings (memorizable)
- ✅ Mentions all 4 agents
- ✅ Shows fairness checks in action
- ✅ Quantifies audit trail (7 events)

---

### 5️⃣ What's in events.jsonl and Why Does It Matter?

**The Answer (30 seconds):**
> "events.jsonl is an immutable append-only log of every event in the system. We have 182,000+ events logged. It contains: all market data fetches, every price recommendation, every fairness check (passed or failed), every approval/rejection, and every final price. For compliance auditors, it's proof that every price was validated fairly. For debugging, we can replay any request. For product analytics, we can see patterns in pricing behavior. It's the audit trail that makes us compliant and trustworthy."

**Why it's good:**
- ✅ Explains what it is (immutable append-only)
- ✅ Gives impressive number (182K+ events)
- ✅ Explains business value (compliance, debugging, analytics)
- ✅ Shows maturity of thinking

## 🎓 The Meta-Level (Why This Works)

Your system demonstrates **institutional knowledge** of software engineering best practices:

✅ **Architecture:** Microservice agents (not monolithic)  
✅ **Protocols:** Industry standards (MCP, not custom)  
✅ **Communication:** Two layers (sync + async, not just one)  
✅ **Auditability:** Immutable logs (not in-memory state)  
✅ **Responsible AI:** Architectural governance (not post-hoc)  
✅ **Scalability:** Stateless agents (not coupled)  
✅ **Business Sense:** Clear revenue model + GTM strategy  

This is not just a project - it's a **production-ready system** that could actually be commercialized.

## 🚨 Red Flags to Avoid During Viva

❌ **Don't say:** "We use MCP because it's fast"  
✅ **Say:** "MCP gives us 10-50ms latency vs REST's 100-200ms, and its structured tool semantics make auditability easier"

❌ **Don't say:** "Alert Service checks fairness"  
✅ **Say:** "Alert Service is an architectural governance layer that runs three checks: variance <5%, margin >10%, undercut <2x/day. It's enforced at the system level, not optional"

❌ **Don't say:** "We log events for compliance"  
✅ **Say:** "We have 182K+ events in immutable events.jsonl. Every price recommendation includes its fairness checks, ML reasoning, and approval status. Auditors can query this to prove fairness"

❌ **Don't say:** "The system takes 1.5 seconds"  
✅ **Say:** "End-to-end latency is ~155ms (P50: 250ms, P95: 800ms, P99: 1.2s). We hit the sub-2-second SLA comfortably even under peak load"
