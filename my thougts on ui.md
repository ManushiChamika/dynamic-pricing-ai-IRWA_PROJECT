Here is what my plan on the front end of this application. First, when visiting the URL of the website, there should be a landing page with all the login page and login button and sign up when you also clicks on those buttons 3. When a user is logged in, they should be redirected to relevant pages. 4. When a user is signed up and logged in, then the user should have the ability to automatically redirect to the web application. This is the real application where stuff are actually happening.
