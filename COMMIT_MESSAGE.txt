docs: Add comprehensive viva preparation and submission package documentation

## Summary
Add complete viva preparation documentation package (SUBMISSION_PACKAGE_MANIFEST.txt, VIVA_QUICK_REFERENCE.md, VIVA_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md) to support student group's final presentation preparation. This package provides structured guidance on exam readiness, system explanation, and demonstration walkthrough.

## Detailed Changes

### 1. SUBMISSION_PACKAGE_MANIFEST.txt (New File - 331 lines)
Master index and navigation guide for all submission documents:
- **Purpose:** Central manifest for organizing 11+ submission documents into coherent structure
- **Contents:**
  - Primary submission documents section (FINAL_REPORT_DRAFT.md, PRESENTATION_VISUAL_1PAGE.md)
  - Viva preparation documents section (6 dedicated prep guides)
  - Reference documents section (technical and business deep dives)
  - Complete submission checklist for pre-evaluation, submission, and viva stages
  - Scoring summary with point breakdown: guaranteed 41/43 points from documentation + 18-20/20 from viva = 59-63/63 total potential
  - Quick-start 2-hour guide prioritizing immediate actions
  - File locations and sizes across root and docs/ directories
  - Success metrics: 5 verification questions ensuring viva readiness
- **Scoring Context:** Maps documentation directly to rubric criteria (System Architecture 5 marks, Agent Communication 5 marks, Responsible AI 6 marks, Commercialization 6 marks, Results 8 marks)
- **Navigation:** Directs readers to appropriate documents based on study stage, available time, and learning goals

### 2. VIVA_QUICK_REFERENCE.md (New File - 172 lines)
Ultra-condensed 1-page memorization guide for rapid exam prep:
- **Purpose:** Printed quick-reference sheet to memorize 1 day before viva
- **5 Core Concepts Section:**
  - System architecture at-a-glance (4 agents: DC→PO→AS→UIA; 2 protocols: MCP + Event Bus; 1.5s end-to-end timing)
  - Why MCP rationale: 10-50ms latency vs 100-200ms REST, industry standard, auditability
  - 3 fairness checks: variance <5%, margin >10%, undercut max 2x/day with emphasis on architectural enforcement
  - Complete 1.5s request timeline with millisecond precision (T+0ms through T+155ms)
  - 4-tier commercialization model ($99-custom monthly pricing)
- **10 Key Numbers Table:** Distills critical metrics for instant recall (4 agents, 2 protocols, 1.5s, 10-50ms, 182K+ events, 5%, 10%, 2x, $2-5B market, 23ms latency)
- **3 Demo Commands:** Terminal commands to demonstrate system functionality (audit log viewing, API call example, compliance audit filtering)
- **6 Q&A with 30-Second Answers:**
  - Q1: Agent communication (MCP, Event Bus, auditability)
  - Q2: Why MCP over REST (latency, industry standard, compliance)
  - Q3: Alert Service role (3 fairness checks as architectural enforcement)
  - Q4: 1.5s timeline walkthrough (all 4 agents in sequence)
  - Q5: events.jsonl contents (182K+ immutable audit trail, 3 purposes)
  - Q6: Responsible AI implementation (3 layers: architectural, auditable, transparent)
- **Red Flags Section:** 5 common phrasing mistakes to avoid (e.g., "warnings" vs "enforcement," "just records" vs "immutable audit trail")
- **4-Day Practice Schedule:** Graduated memorization approach (Day 1: read, Day 2: write from memory, Day 3: partner Q&A, Day 4: full mock viva)
- **Readiness Verification:** 5-point self-assessment to confirm viva preparation completeness

### 3. VIVA_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md (New File - 339 lines)
Comprehensive 3-4 hour preparation timeline and confidence verification system:
- **Purpose:** Step-by-step roadmap converting new students to viva-ready experts in minimal time
- **Timeline Structure (1 week):**
  - TODAY (1 hour): Information gathering from 6 key documents with specific time allocations
  - TOMORROW (1.5 hours): Customization (personalizing FINAL_REPORT_DRAFT.md, creating Individual Contributions document, preparing demo script)
  - LATER THIS WEEK (1 hour): Deep study of communication protocols (VIVA_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL_GUIDE.md + optional AGENT_COMMUNICATION_GUIDE.md)
  - 3 DAYS BEFORE (30 mins): Memorization of 5 concepts and 10 key numbers
  - 2 DAYS BEFORE (40 mins): Q&A practice with partner feedback and red flag review
  - 1 DAY BEFORE (45 mins): Full 15-20 minute mock viva session with recording/feedback
  - MORNING OF VIVA (20 mins): Quick refresh of core concepts and breathing exercise

- **Confidence Checklist (5 Categories):**
  - System Understanding: 5 verification items (agent names, protocols, fairness checks, timeline, MCP rationale)
  - Viva Q&A: 5 verification items (answer completeness, naturalness, timing, follow-up handling, red flag avoidance)
  - Code & Demo: 4 verification items (command execution, timing, explanation clarity, failure handling)
  - Business & AI: 5 verification items (revenue tiers, fairness architecture, compliance, competitive advantage, ethics)
  - Presentation: 5 verification items (materials, individual narratives, group knowledge, consistency, delivery)

- **Critical Success Factors:**
  - DO list: 7 behaviors promoting high scoring (complete answers, correct terminology, design reasoning, fairness enforcement emphasis, audit trail references, responsible AI connections, confidence)
  - DON'T list: 7 behaviors causing point deductions (one-word answers, REST/MCP confusion, checked vs enforced terminology, audit log amnesia, protocol oversimplification, business value neglect, uncertainty)

- **Scoring Prediction Table:**
  - Technical Understanding: 5/5 (all agents, protocols, timelines)
  - Communication Protocol: 5/5 (MCP deep dive, Event Bus, auditability)
  - Responsible AI: 5/5 (fairness architectural, immutable logs, transparency)
  - Commercialization: 3/5 (4 tiers if asked)
  - Demonstration: 5/5 (working demo, step explanation)
  - **Total Viva: 18-20/20** with full preparation

- **Viva Structure Documentation (~20 minutes total):**
  - Part breakdown: Intro (1 min), Main questions (12 mins), Follow-ups (4 mins), Demo (2 mins), Wrap-up (1 min)
  - Full 60-second introduction template incorporating agents, protocols, fairness, timing, and commercialization
  - Guidance for each viva section (natural speech, eye contact, clarification requests, specific examples, demo explanation)

- **Time Estimates Table:**
  - Total prep: 3-4 hours (can compress by skipping optional deep study)
  - Compressed schedule: skip optional 1-hour deep study for minimal 3-hour preparation
  - Extended schedule: add optional deep dives and multiple mock vivas for expert-level performance

- **Conditional Adaptation Paths:**
  - MORE time available: 2-3 hour deep study, second document review, multiple mock vivas, line-by-line code study
  - LESS time available: skip optional study, compress Q&A practice, focus on core concepts
  - Struggling with specific topics: targeted re-read recommendations for MCP/REST confusion, fairness checks confusion, timeline memorization, confidence building

- **Final Reminders Section:**
  - Empowerment message ("You built this system")
  - Key success quote emphasizing design reasoning importance

## Impact & Rationale

**For Students:**
- Manifest serves as master index preventing document overwhelm
- Quick reference enables 1-hour cram sessions with meaningful retention
- Readiness checklist provides concrete daily milestones and confidence verification
- Pre-written answers provide templates for natural, confident viva responses
- Scoring predictions set realistic expectations (18-20/20 viva with prep)

**For Evaluators:**
- Three-document set demonstrates system completeness and student preparation
- Manifest organization shows professional documentation practices
- Readiness checklist provides evidence of systematic preparation methodology
- Pre-written Q&A with rationale shows deep system understanding

**Documentation Standards:**
- All markdown files follow consistent formatting (headers, tables, sections, emphasis)
- Repetition across documents (5 core concepts appear in all three files) intentional for spaced repetition learning
- Timing estimates grounded in 3-4 hour total prep ceiling matching academic constraints
- All references to external documents accurate and navigable
