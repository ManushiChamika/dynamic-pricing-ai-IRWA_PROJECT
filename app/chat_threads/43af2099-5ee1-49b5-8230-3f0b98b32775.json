    "content": "Hello! I'm here to help with the dynamic pricing system. Based on what you can do, here are your main options:\n\n- **Browse product inventory**: Search and list items from our catalog (e.g., by name, category, or SKU) with details like stock levels and current prices.\n- **Check market prices**: View competitor or market pricing data for products.\n- **Review price proposals**: Look at recent pricing suggestions or changes for specific SKUs.\n- **Get price recommendations**: For a given product (SKU), I can optimize and suggest a new price based on costs, margins, and market signals (with optional bounds like min/max price or minimum margin).\n- **Run analytics**: Query the database for counts, sums, averages, or other insights on products, proposals, or market data.\n\nWhat specifically would you like to explore? For example, tell me a product name/SKU, or what data you're after!",

No competitor pricing signal was available to adjust.\n\nIf you'd like to optimize a different item, set custom bounds (e.g., min/max price or margin), or check details on this product, let me know!",
